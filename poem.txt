    Charm is a woman's strongest arm;
    My charwoman is full of charm;
    I chose her, not for strength of arm
    But for her strange, elusive charm.

    And how tears heighten woman's powers!
    My typist weeps for hours and hours:
    I took her for her weeping powers,
    They so delight my business hours.

    A woman lives by intuition.
    Though my accountant shuns addition
    She has the rarest intuition.
    (And I myself can do addition.)

    Timidity in girls is nice.
    My cook is so afraid of mice.
    Now you'll admit it's very nice
    To feel your cook's afraid of mice.
