#If They Meant All They Said
By *Alice Duer Miller* 


**C**harm is a woman's strongest arm;<br>
My charwoman is full of charm;<br>
I chose her, not for strength of arm<br>
But for her strange, elusive charm.<br>


**A**nd how tears heighten woman's powers!<br>
My typist weeps for hours and hours:<br>
I took her for her weeping powers,<br>
They so delight my business hours.<br>


**A** woman lives by intuition.<br>
Though my accountant shuns addition<br>
She has the rarest intuition.<br>
(And I myself can do addition.)<br>


**T**imidity in girls is nice.<br>
My cook is so afraid of mice.<br>
Now you'll admit it's very nice<br>
To feel your cook's afraid of mice.<br>
